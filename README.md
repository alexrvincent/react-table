Hello! This app was bootstrapped with create-react-app. Here's how to get it running!

1) Make sure you have node/npm installed
2) Clone this repo
3) Open up a terminal of your choice and cd into the directory you cloned this into
4) Run 'npm install'
5) Run 'npm run start'
6) This will start the app on default localhost:3000 (make sure nothing else is running on that port!)
7) Go ahead and click on the arrows on the columns and see the rows magically sort themselves! Spooky! :)

Added this line to test doing some PRs numero dos!
